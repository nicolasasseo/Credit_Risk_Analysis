# Credit Risk Analysis using Machine Learning in Python

This was my final project for my Machine Learning class in second year. It uses a `Kaggle` credit risk dataset to predict whether a borrower will default or not.

Includes:
- KNN
- Logistic regression
- Polynomial logistic regression
- Tree based methods:
  - Decision trees
  - Ensembles
  - Random forests 
- SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) to generate fake (but realistic) data samples to nullify the dataset imbalance present in the initial dataset.

Refer to `Presentation.pdf` for the presentation given during the oral defense which goes in further detail about the workflow.
